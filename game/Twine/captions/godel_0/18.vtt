00:00.000 --> 00:04.500 
 Excellent, you're correct.
00:04.500 --> 00:10.640 
 The incompleteness theorems reveal fundamental limitations of formal systems, showing that
00:10.640 --> 00:15.720 
 no single formal system can capture all mathematical truth.
00:15.720 --> 00:22.000 
 This has profound implications for the philosophy of mathematics and our understanding of formal
00:22.000 --> 00:23.000 
 reasoning.
00:23.000 --> 00:26.540 
 Would you like to explore these implications further?
