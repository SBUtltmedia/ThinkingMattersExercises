00:00.000 --> 00:06.000 
 The incompleteness theorems don't imply that mathematical truth is relative.
00:06.000 --> 00:10.000 
 Instead, they show that there are true statements about arithmetic
00:10.000 --> 00:14.000 
 that cannot be proved within a given formal system.
00:14.000 --> 00:21.000 
 This suggests that mathematical truth might transcend any particular formal system.
00:21.000 --> 00:25.000 
 Would you like to explore this idea further?
