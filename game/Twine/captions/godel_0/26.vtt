00:00.000 --> 00:07.240 
 The concept of incompleteness relates to the limitations of formal systems in capturing
00:07.240 --> 00:11.080 
 all truth about arithmetic.
00:11.080 --> 00:16.820 
 It shows that for any consistent formal system powerful enough to encode arithmetic, there
00:16.820 --> 00:21.940 
 are statements that can neither be proved nor disproved within that system.
00:21.940 --> 00:24.740 
 Would you like to explore a specific aspect of this?
