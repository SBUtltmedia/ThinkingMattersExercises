00:00.000 --> 00:05.500 
 The Incompeteness Theorems deal with the limitations of formal systems.
00:05.500 --> 00:11.240 
 They show that for any consistent formal system f powerful enough to encode arithmetic, there
00:11.240 --> 00:16.160 
 are statements that can be formulated in f that can neither be proved nor disproved with
00:16.160 --> 00:17.520 
 an f.
00:17.520 --> 00:19.440 
 Shall we continue with the puzzle?
