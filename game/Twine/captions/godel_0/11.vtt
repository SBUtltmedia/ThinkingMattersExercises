00:00.000 --> 00:08.000 
 The incompleteness theorems show that in any consistent formal system F-powerful enough to encode arithmetic,
00:08.000 --> 00:15.000 
 there are statements that can be formulated in F but can neither be proved nor disproved within F.
00:15.000 --> 00:24.000 
 This doesn't mean all truths are unprovable, but that some truths about arithmetic cannot be proved within the system itself.
00:24.000 --> 00:27.000 
 Shall we continue?
