00:00.000 --> 00:06.340 
 The incompleteness theorems demonstrate that in any consistent formal system f that can
00:06.340 --> 00:11.360 
 represent elementary arithmetic, there are statements that can neither be proved nor
00:11.360 --> 00:13.860 
 disproved with an f.
00:13.860 --> 00:19.080 
 This doesn't mean f is inconsistent, but rather that it's incomplete.
00:19.080 --> 00:21.400 
 Would you like to explore another aspect?
