00:00.000 --> 00:06.080 
 The Incompeteness Theorems show that for any consistent formal system f powerful enough
00:06.080 --> 00:11.600 
 to encode arithmetic, there are statements that can be formulated in f that can neither
00:11.600 --> 00:14.940 
 be proved nor disproved within f.
00:14.940 --> 00:19.900 
 This doesn't mean mathematics is inconsistent, but rather that no single formal system can
00:19.900 --> 00:22.840 
 capture all mathematical truths.
00:22.840 --> 00:27.320 
 Shall we explore another aspect of this?
