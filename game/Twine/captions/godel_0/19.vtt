00:00.000 --> 00:04.880 
 The incomplete mass theorems don't prove that mathematics is inconsistent.
00:04.880 --> 00:10.380 
 Rather, they show that consistent systems powerful enough to encode arithmetic cannot
00:10.380 --> 00:13.140 
 prove their own consistency.
00:13.140 --> 00:15.860 
 This is different from being inconsistent.
00:15.860 --> 00:19.480 
 Would you like to explore the concept of consistency further?
